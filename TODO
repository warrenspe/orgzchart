- when toggling parent/child, position graph so that the node which was interacted with doesn't move overall on the page

- Currently we create elements for every node in the tree, but only position the ones which are requestd on
  page load.  Instead, only load nodes for elements which are going to be displayed, then if we reveal previously
  uncreated nodes generate and position them then
        This will impact defaultRoot code in orgzchart.js and tree.js

- if defaultnode is given, chart loads below y=0 (if its not given it loads at top of screen)
